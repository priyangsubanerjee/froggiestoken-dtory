            question={"How long has Froggies Token existed?"}
            answer={
              <p>
                FROGGIES Token was initially launched back in November 2021 on
                the Ethereum chain. Later a bridge was created to the BSC to
                allow for cross chain transactions and cheaper gas fees. <br />{" "}
                In October 2022 Froggies Token decided to migrate the legacy ETH
                and BSC contract into one new BSC contract. The main reasons for
                this were lower gas fees, a stronger liquidity pool, and the
                greater possibilities of on chain development.
